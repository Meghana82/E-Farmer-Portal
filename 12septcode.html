<h1>Organic Farming:</h1>
<p>Organic farming means farming in the spirit of organic relationship between soil, water and plants; between soil, soil microbes and waste products; between the plant kingdom and the animal kingdom; between agriculture and forestry; between soil, water and atmosphere.Nature adopts different method to supply of nutrients to the soil and maintain the fertility of soil. The supply of nutrients are undisrupted in the nature. The plant leaves produces carbohydrates and later converting these carbohydrates into sugar, starch, cellulose, lignin etc.Organic matter is continually reverting to inorganic state to make mineral salts such as compounds of phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium, iron, magnese, zinc, copper, boron so that these could be available for absorption by the plant roots.</p>

<h2>Practices for Organic Farming:</h2>
<p>* Soil fertility is maintained through cultivation of legumes, green manuring, green leaf manuring, crop rotations, inter and mixed cropping including legumes.<br><br>
* Incorporation of organic materials or crop residues, application of farm yard manure and compost.<br><br>
* Application of bio-fertilizers, Azola, Blue green Algae etc.<br><br>
* Application of minimum tillage practices.5. Adoption of soil and water conservation techniques.<br><br>
* Control of weeds by biological and mechanical method.<br><br>
* Pest and diseases control is achieved mainly by using botanical and biological pest control methods.</p>

<h2>Advantages of Organic Farming:</h2>
<p> * It does not result in any environmental pollution because it avoids use of chemical and plant protection chemicals.<br><br>

* Less energy is used in organic farming compared to conventional agriculture.<br><br>

* Less mechanisation is needed.<br><br>

* Less disturbance of soil, proper structure, high organic matter content will be maintained.<br><br>

* Organic food fetches more price than the produce obtained by conventional methods.</p>

<h1>Home Farming:</h1>
<p>Many of us look forward to locally grow fruits and vegetables,especially those that come from our own soil.For those of you who would like to grow food at home but have limited space, don't despair.Your dream of home-grown food is still within reach.You may be wondering how to grow vegetables if you have little to no space with full sun exposure, but many vegetables will tolerate partial shade, and a few could even be considered 'shade vegetables' as they won't tolerate full sun exposure.Space is not always an issue for an organic farm. If you have a wide-stretching garden or terrace, it serves as a benefit. But residing in an apartment should not come in the way of your organic farming dreams.</p>

<h2>Things to keep in mind:</h2>
<p>* Prepare the soil with cow dung and nutritious compost (to make your compost, order this kit)<br><br>
* Look out for weeds, pests after planting. Once the infestation happens, it isn’t very easy to recover.<br><br>
* Everyday care is a must. Watering with cow dung solution, natural fertilisers etc. shouldn’t be skipped.<br><br>
* Hang yellow or blue boards with castor oil spread on them to prevent pests.<br><br>
* Opt for plants that require more sunlight and need less water: tomatoes, beans, climbers are good examples.<br><br>
* Prioritise those that are vulnerable to infestation in loose soil.<br><br>
* The benefits of terrace farming are they attract less weed, and each plant gets more nutrients.</p>
